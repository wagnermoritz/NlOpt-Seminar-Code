### Code and slides for a seminar talk on numerical and automatic differentiation

This repo contains very basic implementations of one-sided finite differencing, central finite differencing, the complex step method, and reverse mode automatic differentiation used as examples in the talk.

A comparison of the mean errors of the different methods implemented in this repository:
